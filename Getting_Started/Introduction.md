# Introduction

## What is Litex

Litex(/lɪ'tɛks/) is a simple and intuitive formal language, which is inspired by the Set Theory.

## Intuitive

Litex support all common express in math like numbers and calculation symbols. 

Here is an example: to determine the correctness of solution of multivariate linear equation: 2x + 3y = 10, 4x + 5y = 14:

```litex
let x R, y R:
    2 * x + 3 * y = 10
    4 * x + 5 * y = 14
2 * (2 * x + 3 * y) = 2 * 10
4* x + 6 * y = 2 * 10
(4*x + 6 * y) - (4*x + 5 * y) = 2 * 10 - 14
(4*x + 6 * y) - (4*x + 5 * y) = y
y  = 6
2 * x + 3 * 6 = 10
2 * x + 18 - 18 = 10 - 18
2 * x + 18 - 18 = -8
(2 * x) / 2 = -8 / 2
(2 * x) / 2 = x
x = -4
```

## Simple

Litex is more align with the expression habits of natural language. Reserved word of Litex is derived from commonly used mathematical logic expressions. 

Here is an example: to prove sqrt(2) is irrational:

```litex
fn logBase(x, y N) N:
    dom:
        x != 0

know forall x, y, z N:
    logBase(z, x^y) = y * logBase(z, x)
    logBase(z, x*y) = logBase(z, x) + logBase(z, y)

know forall x N:
    x != 0
    then:
        logBase(x, x) = 1

claim:
    not sqrt(2) $in Q
    prove_by_contradiction:
        have x, y st $rational_number_representation_in_fraction(sqrt(2))
        
        x = sqrt(2) * y

        x ^ 2 = (sqrt(2) ^ 2) * (y ^ 2)
        sqrt(2) ^ 2 = 2
        x ^ 2 = 2 * (y ^ 2)
        logBase(2, x ^ 2) = logBase(2, 2 * (y ^ 2))
        
        logBase(2, x ^ 2) = 2 * logBase(2, x)
        logBase(2, y ^ 2) = 2 * logBase(2, y)

        logBase(2, 2 * (y ^ 2)) = logBase(2, 2) + logBase(2, y ^ 2)
        logBase(2, 2) = 1
        logBase(2, 2 * (y ^ 2)) = 1 + logBase(2, y ^ 2)

        logBase(2, x ^ 2) = 1 + 2 * logBase(2, y)
        2 * logBase(2, x) = 1 + 2 * logBase(2, y)

        (2 * logBase(2, x)) % 2 = (1 + 2 * logBase(2, y)) % 2
        (2 * logBase(2, x)) % 2 = 0
        0 = (1 + 2 * logBase(2, y)) % 2

        (1 + 2 * logBase(2, y)) % 2 = 1 % 2 + (2 * logBase(2, y)) % 2
        1 % 2 + (2 * logBase(2, y)) % 2 = 1 + 0
        0 = 1
```

## Expressive

Litex built in all common conceptions of math such as set, group instead of make conceptions implemented via computer language.

Here is an example: to define a group, and prove R and Z are groups

```litex
prop is_group(s set, mul fn(s, s)s, inv fn(s)s, e s):
    forall x s, y s, z s:
        mul(mul(x, y), z) = mul(x, mul(y, z))
    forall x s:
        mul(x, inv(x)) = e
        mul(inv(x), x) = e

fn inverse(x R)R:
    inverse(x) + x = 0

forall x R:
    inverse(x) + x = 0
    x + inverse(x) = 0

forall x Z:
    x + inverse(x) = 0
    inverse(x) = -x
    -x $in Z
    inverse(x) $in Z

$is_group(R, +, inverse, 0)
$is_group(Z, +, inverse, 0)
```
